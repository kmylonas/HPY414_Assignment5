Make sure to make the ransomware.sh executable by running
chmod +x ransomware.sh

Syntax: ./ransomware.sh [-flag] [num_of_files] [directory]

[num_of_files] : The number of files to opearte on

[Flags]:
-e : Creates and encrypts <num_of_files> files with openssl 256 ecb
-d : Decrypts them
-h : Prints help menu


[directory]: You have to use the full path as 3d argument


NOTES:
The files are created using test_aclog which then uses fopen-fwrite.
LD_PRELOAD is already embedded in the script so you just run the script
and file_logging.log will be generated in the current directory.
